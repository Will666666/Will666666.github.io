# Philistinism: What it is, at the first look.

Philistinism is a term used to describe an attitude or outlook that shows little appreciation for intellectual, artistic, or cultural pursuits. Individuals who display philistinism often prioritize practicality and materialism over the pursuit of knowledge or appreciation for beauty in various forms. They may show disinterest or even disdain towards art, literature, philosophy, music, and other expressions of culture, viewing them as irrelevant or unnecessary in their lives.

This mindset tends to favor tangible, immediate benefits over more abstract or intangible aspects of human experience. For example, a person with a philistine outlook might prioritize acquiring wealth, possessions, or social status, seeing them as more important indicators of success or fulfillment than engaging with cultural or intellectual endeavors.

Philistinism can manifest in various ways, such as:

1. **Disinterest in the Arts:** Individuals with a philistine mindset may show little interest in attending art exhibitions, concerts, or theater performances. They may perceive such activities as boring or elitist, preferring instead to spend their leisure time on more mainstream or commercially-driven forms of entertainment.

2. **Minimal Engagement with Literature and Philosophy:** Philistines may avoid reading books, especially those considered classic literature or philosophical texts. They may find such works dense, uninteresting, or irrelevant to their lives, opting instead for lighter reading material or non-fiction focused on practical topics.

3. **Dismissal of Intellectual Discussions:** People with a philistine attitude may dismiss intellectual discussions or debates as pretentious or pointless. They may prefer conversations centered around practical matters like work, money, or personal relationships, seeing abstract or theoretical topics as unimportant or tedious.

4. **Preference for Mainstream Culture:** Philistines often gravitate towards mainstream or popular culture, such as blockbuster movies, reality TV shows, or chart-topping music. They may be less inclined to explore niche or avant-garde artistic expressions, preferring entertainment that is familiar and easily accessible.

5. **Criticism of High Culture:** Individuals with a philistine mindset may criticize high culture institutions like museums, opera houses, or classical music concerts as elitist or out-of-touch. They may question the value of public funding for such institutions, arguing that resources would be better spent on more practical endeavors.

Philistinism can have broader societal implications, influencing educational priorities, public policy decisions, and cultural trends. It may contribute to a devaluation of the arts and humanities in education, leading to reduced funding for programs in these areas. Additionally, a culture that prioritizes philistine values may discourage creativity, critical thinking, and cultural diversity, ultimately impoverishing society's intellectual and artistic landscape.

Overall, philistinism represents a mindset that values material gain and practical concerns over the deeper, more enriching aspects of human experience. While individuals may hold varying degrees of philistine beliefs, fostering a culture that encourages curiosity, creativity, and appreciation for the arts and humanities can help counteract its negative effects.

# Philistinism in High Schools: Examples and Manifestations

Philistinism can be present in high schools in various ways, influencing both students and educational institutions. Here are some examples of how this ideology may manifest:

1. **Curriculum Emphasis**: High schools influenced by philistine values may prioritize subjects perceived as practical or directly applicable to future careers, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), at the expense of humanities subjects like literature, philosophy, and the arts. This curriculum bias can reinforce the idea that academic pursuits unrelated to immediate career goals are less valuable.

2. **Extracurricular Activities**: Schools may allocate more resources and attention to extracurricular activities that have tangible outcomes or competitive success, such as sports teams or robotics clubs, while neglecting or underfunding activities related to the arts, creative writing, or debate. This sends a message to students that activities with measurable achievements are more worthwhile than those focused on personal expression or intellectual exploration.

3. **Social Dynamics**: Within the student body, there may be a prevailing attitude that values material possessions, social status, and conformity over intellectual curiosity or cultural appreciation. Students who excel in academic or artistic pursuits may be marginalized or seen as "nerdy" or "uncool," while those who prioritize fitting in with mainstream trends or achieving popularity may be celebrated.

4. **Teacher Influence**: Teachers, consciously or unconsciously, may reinforce philistine attitudes by focusing solely on exam preparation and rote memorization, neglecting opportunities for critical thinking, creative expression, or interdisciplinary exploration. Teachers who prioritize practical outcomes over intellectual inquiry may inadvertently perpetuate the idea that academic success is synonymous with memorizing facts rather than understanding complex concepts or engaging in meaningful discourse.

5. **Resource Allocation**: Schools with limited resources may prioritize investments in facilities, technology, or programs that have immediate, measurable outcomes, such as standardized test scores or college acceptance rates, rather than investing in arts programs, cultural events, or library resources. This can create an environment where students have limited exposure to diverse perspectives, artistic experiences, or intellectual challenges.

6. **Parental Expectations**: Philistine values may also be reinforced by parental expectations, with some parents pressuring their children to focus solely on academic or extracurricular activities that they believe will lead to tangible success in college or the workforce. Parents who prioritize practical outcomes over personal growth or intellectual development may inadvertently contribute to the perpetuation of philistine attitudes among students.

Overall, the presence of philistinism in high schools can limit students' opportunities for intellectual exploration, creative expression, and cultural enrichment, potentially hindering their personal and academic development in the long run. Recognizing and challenging these attitudes within educational institutions is essential for fostering a more inclusive, diverse, and intellectually stimulating learning environment.


# Critique of 3 ideologies: Philistinism explained in details

Philistinism 144 : 1 (peaceful, boring world/home/territory, all is well), 4 (boredom, irrelevant, no events), 4 (self-willed, the inner first-person experience is basically dominated by the order of field 1, does not obey the prohibition of silence, looks very bold, because the father has not formed the authority of silence (talking all the time, or hitting him, the silent cold violence can restrain him), so the construction of paternal authority is not a hidden, silent, silent, but through the control of his body by zoological instinct, without the control of his mind, the epistemological link cannot be constructed).
Why do people become vulgar? 
They become more mediocre than ordinary. Mama's boys can easily become vulgar because they cannot grasp the mysterious femininity, their sexualization is incomplete, and they do not have a mysterious thing in their hearts to support the dimension of inner psychology, and they cannot build up a sense of problem awareness of "what is she thinking? What is the reason for these thoughts in my heart?"
A father who is 114 behaviorist/134 intuitionist will lead to a child who is 144 vulgar. The education of a person who is 4 in epistemology is basically a failure, because he does not know how to communicate and construct a system of laws through words and language. Therefore, his children are willful on the one hand, and do not know what to do on the other hand. They do not know how to construct their own standards for judging the truth (epistemology) and the good and bad (teleology) of things. The epistemological standard of good and bad is the last territory of vulgarism . Although ontology and epistemology are handed over to 1, teleology can still stubbornly pursue obedience, rebellion, and compromise, and even give up teleology (finished).
At any moment we may become vulgar, the moment we give up thinking in terms of ontology (dimension of violence, hidden and imperceptible dimension behind -ã€‹thinking, fear and other emotions) and epistemology (admit that we are biased and have trade-offs, that things we experience will be classified and conflicting, and that experiences/inner thoughts/intelligence and information are organized in a certain mode) , because the consistency of the field of ordinary people is an inertia of the nervous system, unless the background field can be broken through when making major decisions. In daily life and normality, it is generally 1, and there is a default order in rotation. Of course, there are also people who are always in the 4th digit in the state of mobilization, but it is difficult to maintain and will swing back and forth. It is impossible for people to always maintain a radical negative state. In semiotics, it is impossible for subjectivity. Subjectivity still sprouts from the surrounding environment. Although the environment is inconsistent, it is impossible to be in the 4th digit when eating or drinking.
Why does the closure of 1-4-4- appear ( retrospectively , under certain standards, these two modes do not work, cannot be manifested, and cannot be marked)? 
It can survive in the order of the command/law system, but at the same time it cannot be included in the taxonomy of ideology . No one can talk to it, cannot participate in those dialogues, and cannot have such a dialogue with itself, so vulgarity is a passive vulgarity , never active. Example: playing cards all day long (1441 or 1443, playing according to the rules all day long, playing to the end with a set of rules, not thinking about what is behind it, nor thinking about how it makes me feel, just following the rules. Happy Landlord plays the role of a computer spinning in vain). Why are they vulgar, can only play cards, and cannot be included in the ideological taxonomy? At this time, we need to seek help from Althusser. It is because ideology does not recruit them or question them (the simplest way to put it). Ideology can only generate his subjectivity by questioning a person (forcing the subject to explain whether he has done anything wrong, and wants to discipline the subject. The subject says that he has not done anything wrong and cannot find that thing. At this time, subjectivity emerges). The emergence of a person's subjectivity must rely on the social discourse system . Ideology is permeated in the way everyone speaks and behaves in his neighborhood and the countryside. It also permeates into television, movies, newspapers, the packaging of daily necessities, and all symbolic places in life. However, these things do not question them, which means that in addition to their survival in life and pure physiological needs in the social space, the ideological system has no more expectations for them , does not throw them to the front line , and has no subjectivity. Therefore, their lack of subjectivity is not their own problem. Example: The old man who plays cards every day may be an elder in ancient times, organized between neighbors and family relationships. You see that he is vulgar at ordinary times, but for example, when relatives at home have weddings or funerals, he knows how to play this order. So vulgarity is always a side . We cannot say that a person is completely vulgar, but he can be vulgar in some aspects (for example, in philosophy, most people are vulgar, and there has been no special reflection, such as in medicine). We cannot say that a person is vulgar in his bones. Even if he is vulgar in all aspects, he is not vulgar when facing his mother (who is humiliated by the big Other/the symbol system itself), and he is on combat readiness in all aspects.
Therefore, vulgarity can be seen as a kind of semiotics, which is actually untenable. It is impossible to run in vain. But for example, when you give up something, you feel that everything is settled, everyone starts to play the game according to the rules, and the purpose is uncertain. If you even feel that playing the game itself is boring, then it is 1444. This mental state will lead to pathology. In theory, this hole is self-sealed. 1444 will only be open for a moment, and it must be sewn up, otherwise it will not be able to maintain itself. It is very similar to Psychosis (1443, focusing on oneself). It is impossible to distance oneself from the symbol system , but 144 is uncertain, so there is still a little room to distance oneself, and finally there are some choices in terms of position that can be reversed. 1443 is what Lacan calls a madman. It is not the beggar who thinks he is the King. But if a King thinks he is indeed the King and cannot distance himself from the throne in quotation marks, that is, the assignment and appointment given to him by the symbolic system, then this King is a real madman. He really thinks that he is a king by nature and in his inner essence, and that he occupies this semiotic position. He even thinks that the entire symbolic system was ultimately established and created by him. This is really crazy (some old money). He cannot distance himself from the position he occupies.
