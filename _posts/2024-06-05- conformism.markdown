# Conformism: Understanding Social Compliance

Conformism, in essence, refers to the tendency of individuals to adjust their thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors to align with those of a particular group, society, or prevailing norms. It involves the inclination to comply with social standards, expectations, and customs, often at the expense of personal convictions, originality, or independent thinking.

## Characteristics of Conformism:

1. **Social Pressure:** Conformity typically arises in response to social pressure or the desire to fit in with a specific group or community. Individuals may conform to avoid rejection, gain acceptance, or maintain harmony within the group.

2. **Normative Influence:** Normative influence plays a significant role in conformism, where individuals conform to societal norms and standards to gain approval or avoid disapproval from others. This form of conformity is driven by the desire for social acceptance and approval.

3. **Informational Influence:** Informational influence occurs when individuals conform because they believe that others possess more accurate knowledge or understanding of a situation. In such cases, individuals conform to gain insights or guidance from others, especially in ambiguous or unfamiliar situations.

4. **Group Dynamics:** Conformism is influenced by various group dynamics, including group cohesion, unanimity, and size. Larger groups, unanimous opinions, or cohesive social circles may exert stronger pressure for conformity.

5. **Peer Pressure:** Peer pressure, particularly among adolescents and young adults, can significantly impact conformist behavior. Individuals may conform to the behavior, attitudes, or preferences of their peers to avoid social isolation or ostracism.

## Forms of Conformity:

1. **Compliance:** Compliance involves superficial or temporary conformity, where individuals outwardly adhere to social norms or expectations without genuinely internalizing them. Compliance may occur due to direct requests, commands, or explicit social norms.

2. **Identification:** Identification occurs when individuals conform to the norms and behaviors of a specific group or social identity with which they identify. This form of conformity often involves adopting the attitudes, values, and behaviors of a chosen reference group to enhance social identity or affiliation.

3. **Internalization:** Internalization represents the deepest form of conformity, where individuals genuinely accept and internalize societal norms, values, and beliefs as part of their own belief system. Internalization reflects a sincere alignment with societal standards, often driven by personal conviction or moral endorsement.

## Factors Influencing Conformity:

1. **Culture:** Cultural norms, traditions, and values significantly influence conformist behavior. Cultures with collectivist orientations may prioritize group harmony and conformity, whereas individualistic cultures may value independence and personal autonomy.

2. **Socialization:** Socialization processes, including family upbringing, educational institutions, media, and peer interactions, play a crucial role in shaping conformist tendencies. Individuals learn social norms, values, and behaviors through socialization experiences, which can reinforce or challenge conformity.

3. **Authority and Power:** Authority figures, such as leaders, influencers, or those in positions of power, can exert significant influence over conformist behavior. Individuals may conform to authority figures' directives or expectations due to perceived legitimacy, expertise, or fear of punishment.

4. **Group Cohesion:** The level of cohesion within a group or community can impact conformist behavior. Tight-knit groups with strong social bonds may exert greater pressure for conformity, whereas loosely connected or diverse groups may foster more individualistic tendencies.

## Critiques of Conformism:

1. **Limitation of Individual Autonomy:** Conformism can restrict individual autonomy, creativity, and critical thinking, as individuals may prioritize group consensus over personal beliefs or convictions.

2. **Resistance to Change:** Excessive conformism may impede social progress, innovation, and adaptation to change, as individuals may resist deviating from established norms or traditions.

3. **Potential for Groupthink:** Conformity within groups may lead to groupthink, where dissenting opinions or alternative viewpoints are suppressed in favor of consensus. Groupthink can result in flawed decision-making, irrationality, and conformity to faulty beliefs or decisions.

4. **Social Inequality:** Conformism may reinforce social inequality by perpetuating discriminatory norms, stereotypes, or biases. Individuals from marginalized or stigmatized groups may face pressure to conform to mainstream societal standards, exacerbating social divisions and inequities.

## Conclusion:

While conformism serves important social functions, such as promoting social cohesion, cooperation, and order, it also raises concerns regarding individual autonomy, critical thinking, and social change. Understanding the dynamics of conformism can help individuals navigate social pressures, foster diversity of thought, and promote constructive engagement with societal norms and values.


# Examples of Conformism in High School

In a high school setting, conformism can manifest in various ways, influencing students' behavior, attitudes, and interactions. Here are some specific examples:

1. **Peer Pressure in Social Groups:** High school is often characterized by the formation of cliques or social groups where students may feel pressured to conform to group norms and behaviors. For instance, a student might adopt certain fashion trends, hobbies, or slang terms popular within their peer group to fit in and avoid social exclusion.

2. **Academic Conformity:** In academic settings, students may conform to the study habits, academic goals, or achievement standards set by their peers or teachers. For example, students may feel compelled to pursue certain courses or extracurricular activities that are deemed prestigious or popular among their peers, even if they have different interests or aspirations.

3. **Uniform Dress Codes:** Some high schools enforce uniform dress codes, requiring students to dress in a standardized manner. While dress codes promote discipline and uniformity, they can also stifle individual expression and creativity, as students are expected to adhere to prescribed clothing styles and norms.

4. **Social Media Influence:** Social media platforms play a significant role in shaping high school students' perceptions of social norms and behaviors. Students may feel pressured to conform to idealized standards of beauty, success, or popularity portrayed on social media, leading to issues such as body image concerns, cyberbullying, or the fear of missing out (FOMO).

5. **Group Projects and Peer Evaluation:** In group projects or collaborative assignments, students may conform to group dynamics and decision-making processes to maintain group cohesion or avoid conflict. This conformity can result in unequal distribution of workload, suppression of dissenting opinions, or reliance on groupthink to reach consensus.

6. **Bullying and Social Hierarchies:** Conformism can also contribute to bullying behavior and social hierarchies within high school settings. Students may conform to social norms that promote exclusion, discrimination, or aggression towards peers perceived as different or deviant from mainstream norms.

7. **Pressure to Achieve Extracurricular Success:** High school students often face pressure to excel in extracurricular activities such as sports, music, or academic competitions. Conformism may lead students to prioritize participation in these activities, sometimes at the expense of their well-being or personal interests, in pursuit of recognition or approval from peers, parents, or teachers.

These examples illustrate how conformism can influence various aspects of high school life, shaping students' behaviors, attitudes, and social interactions. Understanding these dynamics can help educators and students navigate the challenges of conformism while promoting individual autonomy, critical thinking, and respect for diversity.

# Critique of ideologies: Conformism

**Conformism 1441**:
- 1 (everyone)
- 4 (terrifying//death)
- 4 (inexplicable//good boy!)
- 1 (follow the crowd, free ride, take advantage of (everyone))

The philosophy of the "little man", the hidden mechanism behind following the crowd, going with the flow, taking advantage of small gains, being complacent, and "everyone does this".

The core of conformism is not to maintain order, but to have a minimal difference, a small gesture of resistance, shamelessness, and making some difference. This minimal difference itself makes him conform. That is, conformity itself is always through a minimal resistance, to create a minimal distance, which can satisfy him. He thinks this thing is the most secretive. When everyone follows the crowd, I can use the smallest trick to secretly deceive it (the big other/everyone).

People who strictly follow the rules are reflective, they don’t just follow the crowd, they know why they have to follow the rules (the overall benefit is good for me, it’s altruistic, such as queuing), people who follow the crowd have no sense of rules, they want to take advantage of everyone, so they follow the crowd; the other type of people who abide by the rules feel good about following the rules, they deal with themselves, and can experience some strange and morbid happiness. Neither of these two types follow the crowd. Strictly speaking, their subjectivity is very strong. Of course, people who follow the crowd also have a strong subjectivity, so the dimension of subjectivity can never be suppressed by obeying any order. The two 4s in the middle of 1-4-4 represent the chaos of subjectivity. The mainstream ideology/order has not established corresponding content in the ontological and epistemological dimensions of his subject, and it is completely undisciplined (a chaotic state where everything is allowed and nothing is allowed).

He sees meaningless, unintegrated into the symbolic system, or the symbolic system that he thinks has not yet been integrated as a form of resistance, as a way to please himself, and the way to please himself is to not be seen. He thinks that if I hide this thing from others, I am not following the crowd. In this process of not letting others see it, he thinks he is resisting and creating a minimum dimension that others cannot see, but in fact, he presupposes that there is such a big other/parent/instructor who is always ready to watch.

For example, you touched your face. The instructor had just said that you were not allowed to touch your face, but you still touched it because you felt good and pretended that the instructor didn't see it. In fact, the instructor might not care about this at all. The reason why the instructor pulled a person who was wiping his sweat and scolded him was that a special way to form a community is to criticize one person. A meaningless and very boring community is to pull one person out and say that you are not good at this. They just want to find an excuse (wiping sweat) to pull him out. However, people who follow the crowd mistakenly think that wiping sweat is a violation, so they wipe their sweat. In fact, they don't realize that others have already passed this stage and have tamed you long ago. Wiping sweat is a secret promise made by the crowd/instructor/order to these people who follow the crowd: I can pretend not to see you wiping your sweat, and tame you in this way. In this way, you think you are not following the crowd and you insist on wiping your sweat. At that time, only wiping your sweat is left. Your subjectivity is limited to a very small, inconspicuous, and insignificant dimension. The big other/order knows that this is insignificant, so it deliberately leaves something behind and deliberately sets this thing as a violation of me (wiping your sweat is a violation of me), "You are not allowed to wipe your sweat and you are not allowed to move." In fact, what he really wants to say is "You can wipe your sweat and move, you can regard this as a gesture of resistance or disobedience, but only this. As long as this thing can satisfy you, you can do it secretly in this way, and then I will cooperate and pretend that I didn't see it." In fact, the instructor knows who is moving when he walks back and forth, and he also knows that standing for a long time is boring. This is a skill. So they thought they had concealed it in their own way, but in fact they fell into a trap.

The word "con" in conform means cheating, fraud, deception, and scam in English. It means form. "con" as a prefix means forming a form, that is, going with the flow. In fact, on the other hand, it can be understood as cheating this form. You think you are cheating this form. I secretly pretend that I am a little bit unqualified. You think you have cheated it, but in fact, it is by limiting your subjective resistance to this dimension that you form this form. There is no perfect form. The formal/background symbol system will openly tell everyone that the position in this formal framework must be rigid or perfect, but the things incorporated into this position will be more or less imperfect. This difference will always exist, and it must be widened. There must always be a difference between the parts that make up the whole and the positions set by the whole for these parts. That is, as a whole, it must contain particularities, and as a large framework, it must contain some local and small things, which means that it cannot fit this thing perfectly. If it fits this thing perfectly, that is, this thing fits this framework perfectly, then everyone will realize that this framework does not exist. What exists are only these individual people and this reference point. The specific thing itself, rather than the position occupied by this thing, will be regarded as a reference point.

A very outstanding person in the company coordinates all kinds of relationships very well in his position, which makes the leaders and other parties very satisfied. After he is good to a certain extent, he actually has problems with the management structure. Because once he leaves, the structure itself is defined by him. No matter how many people are replaced, they are not satisfactory, and the whole system cannot operate. Therefore, from the beginning, this system must set that there must be a difference between my position and the person who sits in my position. There must be a little deficiency or a little excess, so that everyone can believe that such a position exists. After you take office, the boss says: "Your performance is okay, but XXX is not good, too XX", then a fantasy can be supported because the background symbolic order is always a fantasy, always imaginary, and it does not actually exist. It is imagined by everyone, so it must be said in some way (language), everyone's words and thoughts "He is too XX, he is not enough", and these differences need to be reproduced continuously. This difference is a prerequisite for everyone to be willing to enter this framework and a prerequisite for this framework to bring everyone together. This minimal difference is constitutive and important. It is crucial for people to be willing to find a place
