# Vulgarism

**Vulgarism** refers to language or expressions that are considered crude, coarse, or offensive, often due to their association with lower social classes or their use in informal, unrefined, or improper contexts. Vulgarisms can encompass slang, profanity, or any words and phrases deemed inappropriate or disrespectful in polite or formal conversation.

## Detailed Explanation

# Critique of Ideologies: Vulgarism in Detailed Explanation

## Vulgarism 1442

### Core Characteristics

1. **Follow the Crowd:**
   - Individuals adhere to prevailing trends and social norms without questioning or critically examining them.
   - This behavior is driven by a desire to fit in and avoid standing out, often leading to the adoption of vulgar language and behavior.

2. **Dismissive Attitude:**
   - Expressions like "none of my business," "annoying," "fake," "pretending," and "old" reflect a dismissive and cynical outlook.
   - This attitude undermines constructive engagement and fosters a superficial approach to life.

3. **Indifference and Self-Gratification:**
   - Phrases such as "whim on a whim," "don't care," "life is a game," and "the only meaning of what I experience is to be digested/absorbed/possessed/satisfied by me" exemplify a hedonistic and self-centered worldview.
   - This mindset prioritizes immediate gratification and dismisses deeper meanings or dissatisfaction.

4. **Simplistic Pleasure vs. Deep Desire:**
   - The ideology differentiates between direct physiological needs (small advantage) and deeper desires (big advantage).
   - Vulgarism 1442 is characterized by a focus on carnal desires that cannot be elevated or spiritualized, akin to gambling where one seeks immediate, high-stakes rewards.

### The Ideology of Foul-Mouthed Sex Addicts and Gamblers

- **Origins and Mass Production:**
  - This ideology emerged within pre-modern families where certain behaviors and attitudes were perpetuated.
  - These individuals were often raised in environments that prioritized immediate gratification and lacked exposure to higher ideals or restrained behaviors.

### Transition in Western Europe

- **Break from Traditional Family Models:**
  - In the 19th century, Western Europe saw the rise of atomized small families (2+N) that broke away from traditional models.
  - This shift facilitated the emergence of new ideologies and family dynamics, particularly regarding the role of the father.

### The Role of the Father

1. **Ideal vs. Real Father:**
   - The ideal father represents the guarantor of an impeccable rational order.
   - The real father, however, is often incompetent, unable to handle things, and fails to remain rational.
   - This duality creates a short-circuit in the atomized family, leading to conflict and the formation of a specific father image.

2. **Negative Father Image:**
   - A father who categorically denies love and satisfaction represents a negative will.
   - This image is crucial for children to understand the dimension of social order and the power of restraint.

### Impact on Modern Philosophy and Science

- **Emergence of Modern Ideologies:**
  - The laws of modern science and philosophy, rejecting pre-modern hierarchical harmony, led to the development of a new symbolic order.
  - This order emphasizes a reasonless, purely symbolic system, pushing principles to the extreme and fostering rational thinking.

### Vulgar People in Modern Society

- **Lack of Symbolic Order:**
  - Vulgar individuals lack the ability to universalize symbolic orders and are unable to grasp the deeper dimensions of rational thought.
  - They fail to distance themselves from pre-modern love communities and adhere to simplistic, immediate gratifications.
